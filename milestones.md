# Milestones

This document focuses on deliverables and milestones in two sections: those specific to our lab and those for all grad students in the department.

## Lab Deliverables

Every semester our lab engages in goal setting, creating semester reports, and 1-on-1 performance reviews. 

### Goals and Planning

You would never build a house without a set of blueprints.  Along the way you may (probably will) make some changes, but it is much easier to make changes on existing blueprints as compared to making changes with only a vague plan.  There is no one right approach to goal setting, but there are some important common principles including long-term goals, short-term goals, a plan between the two, and accountability.  All elements are essential.  In the following I will use an analogy of learning in a classroom environment, since that is something we are all familar with and the semester is a natural period for our goal setting.  

1. Longer-term goals (semester goals).  If you don't know where you want to end up then all the daily plannning will be aimless.  For our classroom analogy these would be course outcomes.  You need to step back and think about your research and focus on what is essential and impactful.  There are a lot of good things one could do, but you need to make sure you are focused on what is best and let nonessentials drop away.  This requires careful thinking and some time away from the thick of things.  For our lab I recommend using OKRs.  You may use a different format if you prefer with similar principles (the key ones being aspiration guiding objectives, and **measurable outcomes** that support those objectives).  We have a google doc, shared across the lab, to enter our OKRs each semester.  Read an overview [here](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) (there are 10 short pages so you need to click through).  Here are two additional articles that provide [additional guidance](http://eleganthack.com/the-art-of-the-okr/) and describe some [common mistakes](http://eleganthack.com/okr-mistakes-and-how-to-fix-them/).  A few other points not shared in those links: 
- It can be helpful to pair a quantity key result with a quality key result.  For example if you were in a call center and you key result was to make 100 calls, you can easily see how that can be achieved but not lead to a good outcome. But if you instead paired it with a quality result like generate 10 new sales, then you avoid the pitfall of quantity without quality.  (conversely only having the quality goal might not help you stretch to reach the volume you need to achieve the goal).
- It's generally not helpful to list things that are going to happen anyway.
- Remember that key results are *results*, not the habits or inputs that might get you there (these are worthwhile to track to but not the purpose of OKRs), but the outcomes you want to achieve.

2. A plan.  This is the bridge from your daily/weekly goals to your semester goals.  Without this plan it is hard to know if your weekly/daily goals are on track (until you get close to the end and panic-mode sets in).  In our classroom analogy this is the syllabus where the lectures, homework, and exams are placed on a calendar.  This level of planning forces you to grapple with what needs to happen, and what needs to be dropped.  You should describe your week to week activities and set a few key milestones (like exams in the syllabus analogy).  These key milestones will help you track towards your semester goals.  You don't need to go into great detail, just like a syllabus doesn't go into details of an individual lecture, but do need to have a feasible plan.  Format is up to you.  Some people like Gantt charts, simple lists, calendars, etc.

3. Short-term goals.  Even the best-laid plans require constant attention and revision.  Without executation in the short term a great plan is just wishful thinking.  In our classroom analogy this is the detailed description of the homework assignment, or the lecture slides.  At least weekly (or biweekly if you prefer) you should be reviewing your plan and upcoming milestones to help you plan your weekly goals (or sprint goals as we sometimes refer to them borrowing the agile terminology).  Then each day you will be able to plan using your weekly goals.  You will likely need to make revisions to your semester plan from time to time.  You should do so with your big picture goals in mind.

4. Accountability.  It's hard to make progress without some accountability.  In the classroom analogy if you didn't have intermediate deadlines to turn in homework and other assignments, it is unlikely you would achieve the learning outcomes you set out to achieve.  Find what works for you, but at a minimum you should: 1) report on weekly goals each week at lab meeting, and 2) discuss the past semester goals and the upcoming goals during our end-of-semester meetings.  During lab meeting report: what were your goals and how did they go, what are your next week's goals, what is the next upcoming milestone and what is your state of progress towards it.  Don't worry if you're not always achieving your weekly goals.  In fact if you always are then they may not be ambitious enough.  Conversely, if you are consistently not meeting your goals you may need to rethink your plan.  By regularly reporting these patterns and your progress will become clearer to you.  You may want to seek other forms of accountibility: journaling on a slack channel, regular check-ins with someone else in the lab, etc.


### Semester Reports

Each semester (Sp/Su is one semester) you will be required to submit a final report.  Typically, it should be your closest approximation to the journal paper you are working on.  Submit it as if you were submitting to the journal.  I will review it and provide feedback and an assessment.  A prospectus, section of your thesis/dissertation, or research proposal for your next study is also appropriate. The hope is that through regular feedback (and regular careful transfer of ideas/results to paper) your progression will accelerate.  If you submitted an actual conference paper, journal paper, or prospectus that semester then you have fulfilled this requirement.  If you're just starting then it's likely that your paper will be mostly a literature review and methodology (and maybe some very preliminary results)---just like an AIAA extended abstract.  There is no need to start from a blank slate each semester.  Each submission should be an improvement of your current paper until you submit the actual journal paper.

In addition to a report, most of you should also submit code via a GitHub link (code means more than just source code, but also the documentation, tests, structure, commit history, etc.).  We release many codes as open source, and even those stay internal have current/future lab members as potential users.  Taking the time to package code in a well-thought-out manner makes a huge difference (even if the only user is a future you).  Students rarely receive direct feedback on their code development and thus their development in this area is relatively slow.  Like your report, I will review your code submission and provide feedback.  Note: I said *most* of you because some semesters you may be working on experimental data collection or using commercial tools and thus won't have a code submission.

Below I list some questions I will use to assess your submissions, and which you may want to ask yourself during development.

Report: Is the problem you are trying to solve clearly motivated?  Is it an impactful and important problem?  Does the literature review demonstrate a strong understanding of the field and is your work placed in context?  Do the figures stand alone in clearly presenting a message and are they visually appealing?  Is the organizational structure clear?  Are there spelling/grammatical errors?  Do the primary messages shine through?  Are results sufficiently explained and expounded on?  Is there sufficient V&V to lend confidence in the correctness of the results?  Are the conclusions supported by the data?  Is there a clear explanation of what the results mean in a broader context, what the limitations of the work area, and where future work may best be focused?

Code:  Is the code correct?  How do I know it is correct (i.e., are there good tests)?  Does it conform to good style?  Does the chosen interface make sense?  Is the implementation efficient?  Are there better algorithms that should be used?  Is it clear and do I know how to use it?  Is it documented sufficiently that I could modify it if needed?  Are good version control practices being used?


### Performance Review

Each semester we will review your submission, and discuss the following questions in a 1-on-1 meeting:

1. What were your OKRs last semester and how did it go?  
2. What are your OKRs for this coming semester?
3. What are your longer term goals (1 year time frame)?
4. How can I best assist you in achieving these goals?
5. How can you best help others in the lab achieve their goals?
6. Any suggestions or ideas for the lab as a whole?

## Department Milestones

This page overviews some of the milestones you will need to go through as a graduate student.  I do not provide details on the logistics, those you can find in the department graduate handbook, rather I am imparting some advice I frequently repeat to new graduate students.  These are my own views, not all faculty members will view the purposes of these milestones the same way.

### Course Selection

My main advice is to choose courses you are interested in.  You will learn more and have a more satisfying experiencing if you follow your interests.  You may even find some ideas in an unrelated field that help you with your research.  Of course, you will also need to take classes that are directly related to your research, but presumably you are interested in those anyway (otherwise you picked the wrong research topic).  See [Learning > BYU Courses](learning.md/#byu-courses) for some suggestions.

Don't take more than 2 classes per semester.  There just isn't time for that.  Take your classes seriously, but remember that research is always a higher priority over classes.  It can be too easy to linger in the relative safety of classes where there are often known answers and more immediate feedback from homework scores, but you have to prioritize the more important but much harder open-ended questions with no known solution and delayed feedback from research.  This can be a hard  transition for undergraduate students.

If you are a PhD student you will almost certainly find a few interesting and useful classes that won't count towards your degree (e.g., a 400-level CS class, a business class).  Take them anyway!  (within reason).  Although if they aren't relevant to your research, you should save them until after you complete your program of study.  If you are a MS student, unfortunately there just isn't time, but fortunately one or two 400-level technical classes can count for you.

I'd also recommend taking advantage of the unique opportunity you have to take fun 0.5 credit classes like tennis, bowling, martial arts, etc.  Good for the body and mind.  (again, within reason)

A typical course registration looks like the following:
- Fall: 6 credits courses, 1 credit research
- Winter: 6 credits courses, 1 credit research
- Spring: 1 credit research
- Summer: 1 credit research

Taking 1 credit every semester/term should put you on track to complete the necessary thesis/dissertation credits.  Some adaptation will be necessary if gone for a summer internship or if you are an international student (don't register during spring/summer)


### Committee

Your research will have some aspects that are outside your advisor's areas of expertise.  The purpose of a committee is to provide additional expertise in those areas and to provide broader feedback and direction within the same field.  Select other faculty that would be helpful to you.  You don't need to meet with them regularly to report or anything like that.  They are a resource to help you, so meet with them when they can help you with something.  It's ok if you don't know them.  As long as your topic crosses their expertise in some way, they will be happy to help.  All of us serve on a wide variety of thesis/dissertation committees, in most cases with students that we did not know previously.

### Prospectus

You will need to write a prospectus during your graduate work, which is essentially a short proposal.  Writing a proposal is different than writing a scientific paper.  A proposal is intended to be a persuasive argument (rather than a presentation of results and an illumination of their implications).  You need to persuade the reader that the problems you are trying to solve are important, that you've carefully thought through how you will accomplish the work, and that you have the resources and training you need to succeed.  You must have a solid plan, but don't worry that it must be cast in stone.  Like all research projects you should expect that there will be deviations.  The purpose is to help you plan ahead and think about the bigger picture.  Rather than think of this as a one-time document, you should think of it as one step in what should be periodic reflection and replanning to align with what is most impactful and essential.

Make sure you *explicitly* answer the following questions in any proposal, as these are the criteria an evaluator will use to judge its merit.  [These questions](http://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism) come from George H. Heilmeier, a former DARPA director:

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
- Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?
- What are the risks?
- How much will it cost?  (this is less relevant for a prospectus)
- How long will it take?
- What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?


Other advice related to addressing these questions in your prospectus:

- Read this excellent [summary](http://rapids.ucsd.edu/documents/PorterSalesPitch2011.pdf) on how to put together a strong introduction.
- Usually the weakest part I see is the work plan, and that should be the primary focus of the prospectus.  A vague work plan won't help you at all.  If you take this process seriously you will save yourself a lot of time and headache later.  I've gone through the process of writing a proposal on an idea I thought was promising, but after carefully writing it out I realized it wasn't worth pursuing and needed to change direction.  Better to figure that out now instead of later!  A good work plan will provide a blueprint for your research.  Blueprints can change of course, but no one would start building a house with only a vague plan in mind.
- Create a timeline with milestones.  Plan out how long each step will reasonably take, and make sure you have an appropriate scope.
- How will you know you succeeded?  What are the metrics?  If you don't know what success looks like, it will be hard to get there.
- Think about contingencies (especially for a PhD).  Your first and second paper should have a pretty solid plan, but papers 3 and 4 may be dependent on what happens in the first two stages.  Have a backup plan in case your results in those early stages don't follow what you hypothesized.


### Qualifying Exams (PhD)

If you take your preparation seriously, this can be a transformative part of your education.  A PhD student needs to demonstrate impactful and original research (primarily demonstrated through your dissertation), and needs to demonstrate a broad understand of fundamentals (primarily demonstrated through qualifying exams).  In other words, this is a major milestone.  The goal is not to pass the exams.  The goal is to develop a solid understanding of fundamentals.  You should be so well prepared that the exams are a mere formality.  If you are diligent in your preparation you will lay a  foundation of knowledge that you will build on throughout your career.  You will strengthen your ability to learn new things independently---an essential skill in an ever changing world.  You will also find great satisfaction in your deepened level of understanding and greater confidence to move forward into new areas of learning.  There will likely never be another opportunity in your life to dedicate your time and focus so completely to subject mastery in this way, so although it is hard be sure to take advantage of it!  

You need to start your preparation at least one semester prior to taking the exams. Start slow and ramp up.  I strongly recommend studying with a group.  It can be helpful to take turns working problems out on the board in front of the group.  A group provides feedback (essential so that you don't unknowingly learn something incorrectly!), encouragement, and can help you gather a broader set of problems to test your understanding.   During the semester of quals, I recommend taking a lighter course load.  Maybe just one class, unless the two classes are both helpful in your quals preparation.

### Thesis/Dissertation

For a PhD Dissertation your focus should be on journal papers.  As a rule of thumb, it takes four journal papers in a specific area to develop the requisite expertise.  These four papers form the core of the dissertation, and often are inserted directly as four chapters (with annotations for where they were published).  Alternatively, some people like to pull out common intro/conclusion content from the four papers.

Surrounding these papers you will add a few new sections: 1) a unifying introduction, 2) usually a chapter after the introduction that describes fundamentals and background necessary for the rest of the dissertation, 3) a unifying conclusion, and 4) appendices that provide important details like lengthy derivations, model parameters, data sets, etc.

These new sections in the dissertation are different from their journal counterparts.  For 1), a journal paper may only contain a few sentences, because the audience is subject matter experts in the journal's topic.  However, for a dissertation the audience is general and you should assume they come in knowing nothing about your topic.  Motivations, themes, key concepts, etc., need to be described. 

For 2), a journal is space limited so for well-known methods we don't reiterate all the details, but rather provide just enough info that one could still reasonably reproduce.  In a dissertation one generally goes into full and complete detail on most everything.  A good rule of thumb is that the dissertation should stand alone (i.e., one shouldn’t have to refer to other references to figure out derivations or reproduce your results).  You’ll still have references of course (lots), but anything key from those references should be in the document.  This means that some of the background you add isn't necessarily novel, but like a textbook, is repackaged in a way that adds clarity and connection to your topic.  

For 3), the conclusion should be comprehensive across all the papers, and should clearly highlight your unique contributions to the field.

You should have all necessary detail to reproduce your work.  Some of that info is too lengthy or not appropriate in the main text, and that is what the appendix is for.  For big data sets, or code, hyperlinked archived data sources are usually preferable to typed out versions. 

An MS Thesis is similar to described above, but with an expectation of one journal paper.


### Defense

You need to submit your thesis/dissertation to your committee well before the defense (I believe it is a minimum of two weeks, but see the graduate handbook), and it needs to come to me for review 2 weeks before that.  If you find things you need to fix after this date, do not send updates to your committee.  Some of them will have started reading, and if only some members of your committee read the updates it will cause confusion and give the impression that your work is not ready.  You will have an opportunity to make changes afterwords. Like journal reviews there will almost certainly be comments and suggestions for improvement.  

I suggest preparing a handout with your slides printed on them (4 per page, double sided), one for each member of your committee.  This will help your committee follow along and note their questions next to the slides.

The notes on presentations are applicable to your defense.  The only difference is a little more emphasis on clearly highlighting your contributions.

### Post-defense

Many students underestimate the time required to conduct a proper job search.  For a PhD student a job search might span two semesters (less for an MS student).  Visits typically include presenting at a seminar and interviewing with people across multiple levels for a full day or two.  Preparation is needed to deliver an effective presentation, to learn what you can about the organization/people beforehand, and to prepare relevant questions.  The preparation, travel, and interviewing can take a better part of a week, and you'll likely do this more than once.

Knowledge/code transition is important.  You'll need to plan adequate time to document, train other students, integrate code with other lab code so that it can be used by others.
