#### Semester Reports

Each semester (Sp/Su is one semester) you will be required to submit a final report.  Typically, it should be your closest approximation to the journal paper you are working on.  Submit it as if you were submitting to the journal.  I will review it and provide feedback and an assessment.  A prospectus, section of your thesis/dissertation, or research proposal for your next study is also appropriate. The hope is that through regular feedback (and regular careful transfer of ideas/results to paper) your progression will accelerate.  If you submitted an actual conference paper, journal paper, or prospectus that semester then you have fulfilled this requirement.  If you're just starting then it's likely that your paper will be mostly a literature review and methodology (and maybe some very preliminary results)---just like an AIAA extended abstract.  There is no need to start from a blank slate each semester.  Each submission should be an improvement of your current paper until you submit the actual journal paper.

In addition to a report, most of you should also submit code via a GitHub link (code means more than just source code, but also the documentation, tests, structure, commit history, etc.).  We release many codes as open source, and even those stay internal have current/future lab members as potential users.  Taking the time to package code in a well-thought-out manner makes a huge difference (even if the only user is a future you).  Students rarely receive direct feedback on their code development and thus their development in this area is relatively slow.  Like your report, I will review your code submission and provide feedback.  Note: I said *most* of you because some semesters you may be working on experimental data collection or using commercial tools and thus won't have a code submission.

Below I list some questions I will use to assess your submissions, and which you may want to ask yourself during development.

Report: Is the problem you are trying to solve clearly motivated?  Is it an impactful and important problem?  Does the literature review demonstrate a strong understanding of the field and is your work placed in context?  Do the figures stand alone in clearly presenting a message and are they visually appealing?  Is the organizational structure clear?  Are there spelling/grammatical errors?  Do the primary messages shine through?  Are results sufficiently explained and expounded on?  Is there sufficient V&V to lend confidence in the correctness of the results?  Are the conclusions supported by the data?  Is there a clear explanation of what the results mean in a broader context, what the limitations of the work area, and where future work may best be focused?

Code:  Is the code correct?  How do I know it is correct (i.e., are there good tests)?  Does it conform to good style?  Does the chosen interface make sense?  Is the implementation efficient?  Are there better algorithms that should be used?  Is it clear and do I know how to use it?  Is it documented sufficiently that I could modify it if needed?  Are good version control practices being used?


#### Performance Review

Each semester we will review your submission, and discuss the following questions in a 1-on-1 meeting:

1. What were your OKRs last semester and how did it go?  
2. What are your OKRs for this coming semester?
3. What are your longer term goals (1 year time frame)?
4. How can I best assist you in achieving these goals?
5. How can you best help others in the lab achieve their goals?
6. Any suggestions or ideas for the lab as a whole?
