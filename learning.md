# Learning

## Basics

We use the terminal and git heavily in all of our projects.  You'll also want to dive deeper into a programming language.  The language(s) will depend on your project.  We primarily use [Julia](https://julialang.org), but some of our projects use Python with a combination of Fortran and C/C++.  Complete the [starter tasks](https://github.com/byuflowlab/undergrad-onboarding) for new undergraduate researchers if these aren't already familiar.  These cover writing, reading, command line, git, programming, and a starter application project.

## BYU Courses

Here are some classes that tend to be most directly applicable to our lab.  If you are a MS student then ME EN 505 - Applied Engineering Math is generally sufficient.  However, if you are a PhD student it won't be enough mathematical depth. See below for other options.  The list below is not mandatory, they are just suggestions to help you in your course selection.  I encourage you to choose courses based on your interests.

## Textbooks

Depending on what your research topic is, you might find some of the following textbooks useful to become familiar with.  You should *at least* read the first one in each list that is relevant to your research.  Links are for books with available electronic copies (either publicly available or for on-campus students through BYU's subscriptions).  For books with a star* there is an electronic copy on our shared folder in Box.  The others you can purchase, borrow from the library, or borrow from me.

## Journal Papers

- You should be regularly reading new journal papers.  This will help you stay current, will improve your writing, and will help you make connections and discover ideas.  Browsing the publications of some of our peer research groups is another good place to start.
- Not all papers are of equal quality or relevance.  You need to learn how to quickly scan through a paper to discern.  You also don't need to read every paper in depth.  Start by reading the abstract, looking through the figures, and reading the introduction and conclusion.  For core papers to your area you will need to read in greater depth.  You should keep a reference list of papers with a few bullet points on the main ideas.  In our lab we use BibDesk to manage references.
- Start your literature reviews early.  Begin with outlines and fill in details later.

## Research

An effective way to get started in research is to find a good paper in your area of interest (ask those who work in that area for recommendations), and reproduce the results in the paper.  This process will help you get up to speed in an area of interest and along the way you'll likely have ideas for new directions or ways you can build on that work.
